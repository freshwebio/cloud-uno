# Contributing Guidelines

1) Use conventional commits

This project uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automate the generation of change logs, producing release notes and releasing new versions of the software.

A list of the supported conventional commit scopes and types can be found [here](/docs/CONTRIB_CONVENTIONAL_COMMITS.md).

2) The subject line of commit messages should be in the [imperative mood](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#imperative).
