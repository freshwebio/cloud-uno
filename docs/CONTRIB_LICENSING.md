# Licensing for community contributions

The definition of a "major version" in this document is a version that includes new features and not only bug fixes.
A "major version" in this document is NOT as per the definition familiar to most from [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

Each major version of Cloud Uno comes under the Business Source License for the first 3 years.
After 3 years (on the change date specified in the license), that particular major version becomes open source via the Apache 2.0 License.

Contributions made by the community for a major version that is still under the Business Source License or
contributions that will constitute part of a new major version
will be accepted under the "new BSD" license also known as "BSD License 2.0". 
You can find out more about BSD licenses from Wikipedia here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses

Contributions made by the community for a major version for which the change date has passed will be accepted
under the Apache 2.0 License for contributions that provide bug fixes only.
These accepted contributions made under the Apache 2.0 License will not be included in new major versions but can be considered once
the change date has passed for newer major versions.
You are also free to fork that particular version of the project and maintain your own modified version 
under the Apache 2.0 License once the change date has passed.
